# Mesh-based character

In this tutorial we are going to replace the modify the default "Capsule blank character", adding a custom animated model, along with all the neccesary components.

**For the sake of this tutorial i will be using the animated character that's included with the package**, the "Demo Character" model. **You can use any model you want, as long as you follow a few simple rules.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
From now on i will asume that the character part has been fully implemented using the _Implementation_ \(state controller, states, brain, etc\).
{% endhint %}
