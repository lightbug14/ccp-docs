# Description

These tutorials are focused only in the _Core_ part of the package, meaning that the implementation is 100% ignored. This does not mean this section can't be useful if you want to use the implementation. In fact most of the implementation \(especially the states\) is using the Core directly. Besides, a bunch of really basic topics are discussed here.

Also, since these tutorials are aimed to characters and platforms, it will be assumed that the Scene Controller is already added to the scene.
