# Introduction

These tutorials are focused only in the _Core_ part of the package, meaning that the implementation is 100% ignored. This does not mean that can't be useful if you want to use the implementation. In fact most of the implementation \(especially the states\) is using the Core directly. Besides, a bunch of really basic topics are discussed.
