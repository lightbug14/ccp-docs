## What is this?

This is a complete guide that explains \(hopefully\) how the asset works. It has all the information the user need to know in order to set up, use and/or extend the asset. 

* This document is **NOT** a reference to the code -&gt; Read the API reference.
* This document **DOES NOT** explain what a particular field \(from a component\) does -&gt; Read the tooltips associated with a particular field.

## How to read this?

This documentation is divided in three parts:

1. **The package** explains how to do the initial setup, use and update the package.
2. **Fundamentals** takes care of those theorical aspects of the asset.
3. **How to** is much more oriented to specific tasks, quick tips and mini tutorials.

## Is this documentation old?

Not at all, this is the official latest version of the docs. This means that it is updated almost in sync with the latest version of the package \(indicated in the site name at the top left\).

## I have an older version of CCP, Am I doomed?

I always recommend to **get the latest version of Character Controller Pro.** That said, don't worry about this "problem", in general most of the concepts, projects settings and tutorials are similar and probably will remain almost the same.

The concepts are not that much complicated to get, once you understand the basics of the character, you are good to go.

## Is there an easy way to get started?

Check the "How to..." section of this documentation. This section contains quick tutorials and tips about specific topics.
