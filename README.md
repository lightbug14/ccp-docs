# Introduction

Hi! I'm Lightbug, welcome to the **Character Controller Pro** Documentation. This document contains \(hopefully\) all the material you need to understand the basics of this asset.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Note:**_ This document explains the basics of _Character Controller Pro_ the best way possible. It was written as a guide/manual with descriptions, definitions, images and side notes. If after reading this manual you feel confused somehow or have questions about the package, please send me an email. 

Also really important to mention, **English is not my primary language, so bear with me**, **Iâ€™m doing my best** ðŸ™‚ .

## How to read this?

It depends on how far you want to go with this package. If you got CCP only to use as it is, you can ignore the fundamentals and a good part of the tutorials. Just make sure to read the Introduction section.

On the other hand, if you want to take full advange of the package please read the whole documentation.

## Is this documentation old?

Not at all, this is the official latest version of the docs. This means that it is updated almost in sync with the latest version of the package \(indicated in the site name at the top left\).

## I have an older version of CCP, Am I doomed?

As always I would recommend to **get the latest version of Character Controller Pro.** That said, don't worry about this "problem", in general most of the concepts, projects settings and tutorials are similar and probably will remain almost the same.

## Is there an easy way to get started?

There is a [quick guide]() section available.
