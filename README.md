# Introduction

Hi! I'm Lightbug, welcome to the **Character Controller Pro** Documentation. This document contains \(hopefully\) all the material you need to understand the basics of this asset.

_**Note:**_ This document explains the basics of _Character Controller Pro_ the best way possible. It was written as a guide/manual with descriptions, definitions, images and side notes. If after reading this manual you feel confused somehow or have questions about the package, please send me an email. 

Also really important to mention, **English is not my primary language, so bear with me**, **Iâ€™m doing my best** ðŸ™‚ .

## How to read this?

First, please make sure to read the first sections \(Content, Versions, Setup, etc\). 

If you got CCP only to use as it is, you can ignore the main part of this documentation.

On the other hand, if you want to take full advange of the package please read the whole documentation. The fundaments explains the basics of the main components, the character rules, scene setup, some of the features in more detail, and so on.

## Is this documentation old?

Not at all, this is the official latest version of the docs. This means that it is updated almost in sync with the latest version of the package \(indicated in the site name at the top left\).

## I have an older version of CCP, Am I doomed?

As always I would recommend to **get the latest version of Character Controller Pro.** That said, don't worry about this "problem", in general most of the concepts, projects settings and tutorials are similar and probably will remain almost the same.

The concepts are not that much complicated to get, once you understand the basics of the character, you are good to go. If you need help with the scripting, there is an API reference included in the package that will help you, regardless of the asset version \(offline\). 

## Is there an easy way to get started?

Check the "How to..." section of this documentation. This section contains quick tutorials and tips about specific topics.
