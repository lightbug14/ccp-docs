# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/KeyImage\_Cover.png)

## What is this?

This is the online documentation for _Character Controller Pro_.&#x20;

## How to read this?

This documentation is separated into three parts:

* The _**The package**_ section describes how the asset package should be downloaded, imported and updated, as well as how to set up the asset.&#x20;
* The _**Fundamentals**_ section explains how the all the features work from a theoretical point of view.
* The _**How to...**_ section is meant to be a very modular quick start guide.

## Does this documetation describe classes, methods and fields?

It doesn't. For that, please read the [API reference](https://lightbug14.github.io/lightbug-web/character-controller-pro/Documentation/html/index.html).

## What about inspector fields?

Take a look at the [tooltip](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/TooltipAttribute.html) associated with a particular field.

## Is this documentation old?

The package version is indicated next to the title at the top left. Normally, the documentation is in sync with the lastest package released.

## I have an older version of CCP, What should i do?

I always recommend to **get the latest version of the asset if possible.** That being said, most of the core concepts and features won't change a lot from version to version, so you should be able to use this documentation without any problem.

## Is there an easy way to get started?

Go to the _How to..._ section. This is great if you want to create any custom behaviour you want (coder pov).&#x20;

Also, please check the prefabs included with the asset, especially the Character + Camera combination assets.
