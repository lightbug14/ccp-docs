# Adding the state machine

## 1. Add the CharacterStateController

The _CharacterStateController_ is a _CharacterActorBehaviour_, with the particularity of being also a finite state machine. As you can see it requires a _**CharacterState** \(which we don't have right now\)_.

The movement reference is explained in the [Character state controller](../fundamentals/implementation/character-state-controller.md#movement-direction) section.

All the required states need to be added 

## 2. Adding the Brain

You don't really need to "add" the brain component after adding the _CharacterStateController_. This is wil be automatically added for you \(since it's a required component\).
