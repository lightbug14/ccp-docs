# Roadmap

This section serves as a way for me to inform you about the current development state of some new features and bugs fixes. 

A feature can be in one of the three "levels" of development:

* **Experimental:** Just an idea, i'm just experimenting.
* **In Development:** The feature is in development \(this doesn't mean that the feature will be ready\).
* **Ready:** It's done! this is going to the next release.

## Features

#### Experimental

* One Way platforms for 2D and 3D.

#### In Development

* 3D Camera:
  * First person camera mode.
  * More Third person camera modes.

#### Ready

## Bugs
