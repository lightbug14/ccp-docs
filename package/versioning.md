# Versions and updates

You should always update to the new version, unless the **risk** of doing so is high enough for your particular project \(in some cases it is best to keep using an old version\).

The version number indicates the **type** of update, but also the **risk** involve. The versioning scheme used for CCP is the following:

#### Major.Feature.Minor

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Minor</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Basically bug fixes<b>,</b> code improvements, etc. This update is <b>always recommended</b>,
          it should not give you any issues.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk:<b> Zero </b>&#x2705;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Feature</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p><b>New </b>features and/or features <b>improvements</b>. When i say features
          i mean technical features related with the Core and/or implementation content
          (the Demo content might be included as well). Obviously feature additions
          and improvements require some API modifications, so <b>this might cause some issues</b>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk: <b>Low to medium </b>&#x26A0;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Major</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>A major update is used as an opportunity to re-invent some of the main
          features of the assets (if necessary, of course). By doing so it&apos;s
          expected to create some sorts of components and API incompatibilities.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk: <b>Maximum </b>&#x2622;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

## Support

Let me make this clear: **I will always put all my effort in the latest version of the package**. In my own eyes that's the best this package can get, and i will always recommend you to get that version.  

{% hint style="info" %}
This doesn't mean i won't help you if you don't have the latest release. 
{% endhint %}

## How to update

To update the package \(regardless of the version\) is recommended to **delete the** _**Character Controller Pro**_ **folder** and then import the new version. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember always to put your own work outside this folder.
{% endhint %}
