# Versions and updates

If you have been using Unity over the last years you probably know that updating a software is risky. Sometimes decisions must be made for the benefit of the asset \(even when the users are not so happy about it ðŸ¤¬\).

Of course there are certain levels of risk, that's why you should pay attention to the **version** you are updating to.

The versioning scheme used for CCP is the following:

#### Major.Feature.Minor

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Minor</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Basically bug fixes, small changes, code improvements, etc. This update
          is always recommended, no risk at all.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Feature</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>New features, small updates, a new fancy component, etc. Beware! It might
          break some things.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Major</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>This update will break almost everything for sure, this means a new fresh
          start, new systems, new components, an overall change.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Support

Let me make this clear: **I will always put all my effort in the latest version of the package**. In my own eyes that's the best this package can get, and i will always recommend you to get that version.  

{% hint style="info" %}
This doesn't mean i won't help you if you don't have the latest release. 
{% endhint %}

## How to update

To update the package \(regardless of the version\) **is recommended to delete the** _**Character Controller Pro**_ **folder in its entirely**, then import the updated version. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember always to put your own work outside this folder.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It would be great if you make a backup of your CCP related data first. Sometimes changing a variable or class name can ruin your data. You have been warned!
