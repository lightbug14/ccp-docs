# Versions and updates

You should always update to the new version, unless the **risk** of doing so is high enough for your particular project \(in some cases it is best to keep using an old version asset\). Still, you should always \(if possible\) test a clone of your project with the new version.

The version number indicates the **type** of update. The versioning scheme used for CCP is the following:

 Major.Feature.Minor

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
      <th style="text-align:left"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Minor</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Basically <b>bug fixes</b>, code improvements, etc. This update is always
          recommended, it should not give you any issues.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk:<b> Zero </b>&#x2705;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&quot;You won&apos;t notice any difference&quot;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Feature</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p><b>New </b>features and/or features <b>improvements</b>. When i say features
          i mean technical features related with the Core and/or implementation content
          (the Demo content might be included as well).</p>
        <p>Obviously feature additions and improvements require some API modifications,
          so this might cause some issues.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk: <b>Low to medium </b>&#x26A0;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&quot;You will get the same asset, but the new stuff will be very noticeable&quot;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>Major</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p></p>
        <p>A major update is used as an opportunity to re-invent some of the main
          features of the assets. By doing so it&apos;s expected to create all sorts
          of components and API incompatibilities.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Risk: <b>Maximum </b>&#x2622;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>&quot;A remake&quot;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Support

Let me make this clear: **I will always put all my effort in the latest version of the package**. In my own eyes that's the best this package can get, and i will always recommend you to get that version.  

{% hint style="info" %}
This doesn't mean i won't help you if you don't have the latest release. 
{% endhint %}

## How to update

To update the package \(regardless of the version\) **is recommended to delete the** _**Character Controller Pro**_ **folder in its entirely**, then import the updated version. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember always to put your own work outside this folder.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
It would be great if you make a backup of your CCP related data first. Sometimes changing a variable or class name can ruin your data. You have been warned!
