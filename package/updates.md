# Updates

### Updating the package

Firsto of all, when a new update of CCP is available you should check its type. Is it a minor update? then update without thinking. Is it a feature update?

To update the package \(regardless of the version\) is recommended to delete the _Character Controller Pro_ folder in its entirely, then import the updated version. Remember always to put your own work outside this folder.
