# Content

_Character Controller Pro_ is organized in three big parts:

### Core

The main part of the package, it does the heavy lifting regarding collision detection, character information, movement, etc. If you want to extend the package or maybe you don't like the current implementation, you should use the core, it will give all the necessary tools to create your character on top.

### Implementation

Consist of a bunch of components that implement the functionality of the _Core_. These components cover many aspects and intend to create a "character ecosystem" around the _Core_. This part of the package can be customize and/or extended if needed.

### Demo

Basically all the assets used for the making of the demo scenes, from materials and sprites, to pure data containers.
