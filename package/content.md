_Character Controller Pro_ is organized in three hierarchical parts:

### Core

Contains the the main components associated with the "character controller". These components are responsible for  making the character move/rotate/scale properly in the scene.

### Implementation

Consists of a bunch of components that implement the functionality of the _Core_. These components cover many aspects and intend to create some sort of "character system" around the _Core_. This part of the package can be customize, deleted and/or extended if needed.

### Demo

Contains all the assets used for the making of the demo scenes \(character abilities, UI components, meshes, sprites, scriptable objects, etc\).

**IMPORTANT:** Most of the logic and gameplay components belong to the Demo. These components do not represent the **technical features** of the asset \(e.g. animation support, collision events, etc\).
