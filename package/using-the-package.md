# Using the package

Ok, you have played the scenes, dig into the code, maybe playing around with some values. What now?



The recommended way to use this package \(and every package out there, really\) is by working on a separated path \(outside the _Character Controller Pro_ folder\). This is useful if you need to use and/or extend the asset in any way.
