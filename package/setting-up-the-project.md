# Setting up the project

The main content of **Character Controller Pro does NOT require customized project settings, it is not hard-coded in any way or form**. However, if you need to test the demo scenes that comes with the asset you'll find a problem. This is why you need to set up the project first.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Setting the project is not the same as adding a full character in the scene.
{% endhint %}

## Importing the package

Once the package has been imported, your project view should look like this:

![Project hierarchy.](../.gitbook/assets/project\_hierarchy.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you open a scene from the asset and click play you might get several errors and warnings. This is because the demo content requires a few customize settings from the project (**tags** and **inputs**).
{% endhint %}

A big welcome screen should appear right after clicking the import button. This screen contains some useful links and more importantly, the setup instructions:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/imagen (87).png>)

Luckily for you there are **presets** included in the package that will help you to configure your project by doing two or three clicks. For more information please see [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html) link.

For example, in order to apply the input settings that come with the CCP:

Go to the InputManager, open the preset window (top right, see the image)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/imagen (15).png>)

Then select the preset by double clicking it:



![](<../.gitbook/assets/imagen (16).png>)

Do, the same with the tags presets.
