# Setting up the project

Some assets do not work as expected after importing them into the project, sometimes some settings need to be modified. **Character Controller Pro does not requires anything from you or your project settings in order to work**. However, the problem here are the demo scenes, which use tags and specific input settings.

### Importing the package

Hit the import button! Once the package has been imported your project view should look like this:

![Project hierarchy right after importing the asset.](../.gitbook/assets/project_hierarchy.png)

Also, a big welcome screen should appear right after. This screen contains some useful links and more importantly, the setup instructions.

Luckily for you there are presets included in the package that will help you to configure your project by doing two or three clicks.

1. Load the preset associated with the input manager settings.
2. Load the preset associated with the tags and layers settings.

For example, for the Input settings, go to the InputManager:

Then select the preset, double click it:

![](../.gitbook/assets/imagen%20%2816%29%20%281%29.png)

 That's it!
