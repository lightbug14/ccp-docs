# Character Actor

The _CharacterActor_ component follows a few simple rules that needs to be understood in order to use it. These rules are related to teleportation, size, position and rotation. All the actions required from the _CharacterActor_ have a deferred nature, this means that they are not executed immediately. All the changes are applied when the _CharacterActor_ needs to.

The main properties to look for are shown in the next image. The _CharacterActor_ offers a few public methods and properties that allow you to define these properties.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/core_flow.png)

The following sections explain how all these individual elements work internally.

## Teleportation

If the character needs to change instantly its position and/or rotation \(ignoring the collision detection algorithm\) then the Teleportation method should be used.

## Size

Internally the size of the character is stored in a Vector2 variable called \texttt{bodySize}. The x component represents the width and the y component represents the height. The initial size will be assigned based on the capsule collider parameters and some internal constants.

The size can be set externally by a script, by passing any possible value as the desired size. Since the character may or may not fit in a given space, the size must be internally checked beforehand by the _CharacterActor_, thus defining the final character size.

## Orientation

The orientation is completely managed by the \textit{CharacterActor} component. Any external change to the character rotation will be overwritten. There are two ways to describe a normal character rotation:

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Gravity  | The current gravity direction will define the character up vector as its opposite. |
| Yaw  | This is the rotation motion around the local _up_ axis |

The character is capable of changing its rotation values by using the gravity information. This is possible by using the gravity direction and graviy modes from the CharacterActor component. For example, in figure \ref{fig:gravity} the character is align itself using the gravity vector.

On the other hand, **the character cannot do yaw rotation at all**, instead it has a _forward direction_ vector, which can be defined and used for the user at will. This vector will be properly rotated internally by the _CharacterActor_ \(gravity shifting scenarios and dynamic ground motion\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/lookingdir.png)

It is important to mention that **the forward direction vector will always be projected onto the plane formed by the character up direction**. If a random vector is defined as forward direction, this will be projected onto this plane.

## Position

The change in position related to a \textit{LinearVelocity} field. The necessary displacement is calculated based on the current linear velocity value. This movement will take into account collision detection. The \textit{LinearVelocity} vector needs to be set externally by a script.

The movement algorithm is based on the classic _Collide & Slide_ algorithm. Although is not necessary to do a bunch of collision test in order to prevent the character to pass through other colliders \(since this is a rigidbody based character controller\), these test are still performed anyway. This is because the character gathers information from the environment and also can predict its movement before hand, which is really useful.

### Grounded state

The movement can be classified in \textit{Grounded} and \textit{Not Grounded}, depending on the current grounded state. Both type of motion have its differences, the not grounded movement only performs the basic collide and slide action, while the grounded movement does the same but also includes all the available features \(step detection, edge detection, edge compensation, etc\).

_**Grounded**_ **to** _**Not Grounded**_ ****To make the transition you must force the not grounded state externally. If you are using gravity in your script remember to apply a positive vertical velocity \(towards the character up vector\), otherwise the character will return to the grounded state the next frame.

_**Not Grounded**_ **to** _**Grounded**_ ****In this case you must apply a negative vertical velocity \(towards the character up vector\).

### Stability

A character is stable when it is grounded and the _stable slope angle_ \(see the API reference\) is less than or equal to the _slope limit_ value.

```csharp
stable = IsGrounded && ( stableSlopeAngle <= slopeLimit ); 
```

This angle should not be confused with the _slope contact angle_, obtained directly from the collision test. They both are not the same:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/contactvsstable.png)

The concept of stability is used internally by the _CharacterActor_ to detect steps, edges, do ground probing, and so on. By itself it will not produce any type of movement, but it can be used for creating custom movement behaviours. For example, in the package implementation, a grounded + unstable character will slide down from the slope it is currently standing on. Referring back to the previous figure, the character will not fall since the stable slope angle \(from the stable normal\) is allowed.

### Velocity Projection

The _LinearVelocity_ vector provides the information needed to move the character from point A to point B. However, this vector is not used directly to calculate the actual displacement, since it may not follow the _CharacterActor_ internal movement rules. This can be a problem only when the character is grounded.

In order to use a valid displacement vector, the linear velocity must be projected onto the current slope plane. The _CharacterActor_ will take the linear velocity field and do the projection \ul{maintaining its magnitude}. This can be seen much more clearly in figure \ref{fig:velocityproj}.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/velocityproj.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** the displacement vector is prjected onto a certain plane keeping its initial magnitude. This basically means that the character will always move at its input velocity magnitude, regardless of the slope angle.
{% endhint %}

### Slopes handling

The character can walk onto any stable slope. Prior to the movement calculation a displacement vector is created \(based on the linear velocity\) and subsequently modified in the process. The collide and slide algorithm will iterate over and over until the displacement magnitude is less that the minimum movement amount constant, or the number of iterations performed exceeds the maximum number of slide iterations.

If the encountered slope is allowed the character will walk onto it, modifying the displacement vector. if not the slope will be considered as an invisible wall.

### Steps handling

#### Step Up 

The character is able to walk over steps of any height \(although it may look weird in some situations\). The basic rules used to trigger the step up functionality are simple. During the collide and slide stage, if the character hits a wall \(close to 90 degrees Â± a tolerance\) or if hits an edge, it will perform a "step up''. After the process, if the ground surface is unstable the step up action will be ignored \(reverting the changes\), and the step will be considered an invisible wall \(same as an unallowed slope\), recalculating the displacement vector.

To determine the stability of the new potential surface an edge detector is used . This allows to measure the upper and lower normal. Depending on the situation the chosen normal will be one or the other. The edge detection is independent from the orientation.

#### Step Down

The step down algorithm \(also known as ground clamping or ground snapping\) will force the character to the ground if the ground probing distance is less than the \texttt{StepDownDistance}. This is useful to prevent the character to be launched off a slope or step.

The **ground probing distance** is distance between the character foot position and the closest ground point measured.

### Edge Compensation

Normally, when a character is standing on an edge it collision shape will make contact with it.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ledgenormal.png)

Sometimes detecting the ground using a box shape can be the best option, especially for platform games. The character actor includes an _edge compensation_ feature, simulating a box shape for ground detection in edges.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ledgeon.png)

This feature works only on edges, for slopes you will get the same results as before \(with edge compensation disabled\).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/ledgeon_slopes.png)

The _edge compensation_ feature brings the advantages of the box for edgesand the capsule for slopes.

### Dynamic Ground

If the character is standing on a valid dynamic ground\footnote{Kinematic rigidbody moved and/or rotated using kinematic motion, either by script or via animation \(with \`\`Animate Physics'' enabled\).} and this object is moved or rotated, the character will act properly to move/rotate along with it, always following its own orientation rules. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:dynamic}, see how the character maintains its rotation while it moves accordingly with the platform.
