# Character actor

The _CharacterActor_ component can be also referred as a "character-oriented rigidbody". Most of the time you will be changing the position, rotation and/or the velocity of this component in order to create your own gameplay logic. 

The job of the CharacterActor is to **ensure that all the changes to the actor are being applied correctly based on a set of predefined "rules"**. The best way to explain this component is by exposing some of these rules and properties.
