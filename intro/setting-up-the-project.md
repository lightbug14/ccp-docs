# Setting up the project

### Importing the package

Once the package has been imported your project view should look like this:

![Project hierarchy right after importing the asset.](../.gitbook/assets/project_hierarchy.png)

The first thing to do is to open the folder _\`"OPEN ME"_ . In there you will find all the necessary material to put this package to work. In order to make CCP fully functional \(at least for demo purposes\) you need to adjust some Unity's settings.

The imported package contains a few presets, these are related mainly to _Layers_ and _Inputs_. Apply these presets to your project, after doing this you will visualize all the layers with their appropriate names, and the inputs buttons will be registered in the input manager.

The layers and inputs settings are necessary initially for demo purposes only. If you want to use CCP in your own project you can redefine these settings to your liking.

### Using the package

The recommended way to use this package \(and every package out there, really\) is by working on a separated path \(outside the \textit{\`\`Character Controller Pro''} folder\). This is useful if you need to use and/or extend the asset in any way.

### Updating the package

To update the package \(regardless of the version\) is recommended to delete the \textit{\`\`Character Controller Pro''} folder in its entirely, then import the updated version. Remember always to put your own work outside this folder.
