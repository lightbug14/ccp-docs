### Description

Character Controller Pro \(CCP for short\) is a 2D/3D Dynamic Character Controller that allows you to handle the movement, rotation and size of your character \(among other things\) in a precise way.

The main highlights of the package are listed below:

* **Hybrid approach:** This character controller is Dynamic by nature, this means that the character uses a collider and a dynamic rigidbody to detect collisions and to do movement. However, almost all of its actions are predicted/calculated in a \`\`kinematic way''. This was intended that way in order to combine the best of both worlds, that is, the preciseness of a kinematic character and the collision detection/rigidbodies interaction of a dynamic character.
* **Capsule body shape:** The character is modelled as a 2D/3D upright capsule.
* **2D and 3D Physics:** This package supports 2D and 3D Physics, meaning that your character will detect and interact with 2D and 3D Colliders as well.
* **2D and 3D Movement:** Every component available in the package was created with 2D/3D movement in mind. No behaviour is specific neither to 2D nor 3D space.
* **Rigidbodies interaction:** Since the character is dynamic it can interact with other rigidbodies, push them, get pushed by them, and gather information from the interaction.
* **Technical level:** This character controller not only gives you good results, but also technical information about the world the character is interacting with.
