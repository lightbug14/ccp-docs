# Rotate a 2D character

The 2D world is very different from the 3D world, especially regarding rotations.

In order to handle rotations properly you just need to add a "graphics component" to the graphics object. It's important to separate the graphics \(3D mesh or sprite\) from the actual character. For more information about 2D rotation please see the [Character actor](../../fundamentals/untitled/character-actor.md#rotation) section. 

 In this case you need to add a CharacterGraphics2DRotator to the mesh or sprite you have.
