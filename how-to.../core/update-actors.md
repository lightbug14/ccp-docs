# Update actors

**Characters** and **kinematic platforms** are considered **actors**.

The first thing to do is add the _scene controller._ This component is sort of like a master update component \(all characters and kinematic platforms need one of this\). You can add the _SceneController_ component to an empty object, or simply drag & drop the "Scene Controller" prefab into the scene.

**This action is needed always!** So, in future tutorials i will ignore it. Just remember that you always need to put one of these in your scene.
